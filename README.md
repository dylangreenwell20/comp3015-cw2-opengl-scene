# COMP3015 CW2 OpenGL Scene Submission - 10752010
This is my submission for COMP3015 - Coursework 2. I have added PBR lighting to my previous scene and almost implemented a particle fountain which should work but one error is causing it to not display particles.

# Features
**PBR Lighting** - I implemented a PBR lighting system which works as intended - objects respond to light from the scene and variables can be changed (such as base colour) to change how objects look in the scene.

**Particle Fountain** - The code has been added to have a working particle fountain but I could not get it to load due to a uniform/location error which I could not find the cause of. With some more time and bug fixing, this could be fixed and the particle fountain would work.

# Scene Overview
Following up on the CW1 scene, this is meant to be a scene showcasing a cave using a rock model. Originally, there was a skybox too but implementing PBR ended up making the texture for the skybox go black. I did not have time to fix this due to trying to get the particle fountain bug fixed.

# Libraries/Specs
I only used the libraries provided with the project template and coded on a Windows 10 system using Visual Studio 2022.
